 * background.c: background index-level skip list maintenance

Module Overview

This module provides the routines necessary for skip list
maintenance to be performed in the background by a single
maintenance thread, as in the algorithm specified here:
Crain, T., Gramoli, V., Raynal, M. (2013) 
"No Hot-Spot Non-Blocking Skip List", to appear in
The 33rd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing 
Systems (ICDCS).

Maintenance to be performed in the background includes all
modifications to the index levels of the skip list, as well as
completion of deletions from the node level that are logically
complete but not physically complete (i.e. logically deleted 
nodes that are still reachable).

The idea behind having a background thread carry out these operations
as opposed to allowing all worker threads to modify index items 
during operation is that we avoid contention on the upper index levels.
If a skip list is subject to many update operations by many competing 
threads, then the upper index levels become contention hot spots, 
and as threads contend over these updates they
are effectively serailised due to their interference with one
another. Having a single thread adjust the index levels completely
removes the issue of index-level contention.

The background thread performs its duties by continuously traversing
the skip list and performing adjustments along the way. Since
index modifications are not multi-threaded, the requirement that
the number of index nodes at level i is approx n*(2^-i) 
(where n is the number of nodes in the skip list) can be
enforced deterministically, rather than probabilistically as is
common with other multi-threaded skip list implementations. 
However, even though balancing is deterministic this does not mean
there are concrete guarantees about how balanced the list will be at a
certain point in time. The balancing of the skip list is influenced
by how often the background thread is running and the operations
being carried out by other worker threads.

The background can be set to run only intermittently in order to
reduce the negative impact on performance the background thread can
introduce. If the background thread is constantly running then this
can interrupt other threads trying to traverse the list, as the background
thread may cause cache invalidations in other threads and cause costly
reads from memory to occur.
